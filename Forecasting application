## The real-time forecasting application

The real-time forecasting application consists of two scripts: functions.py and executeGUI.py

executeGUI.py creates the GUI interface that asks users to set the forecasting window, number of simulations, quantiles to predict, and update frequency.


functions.py contains all the functions that are required by the GUI application.
