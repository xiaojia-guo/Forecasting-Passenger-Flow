## Code for Forecasting Transfer Passenger Flows at Heathrow

This code is used in our paper "Forecasting Airport Passenger Flows Using Real-Time Data and Machine Learning". In collaboration with Heathrow airport, we develop a predictive system that generates quantile forecasts of transferring passengers' connection times, and the number of passengers arriving at the immigrating and security areas.

The predictive model developed is based on a regression tree combined with copula-based simulations. We generalize the tree method to predict complete distributions, moving beyond point forecasts.
